rbench is a development enviroment for hash tables which includes:

  1. librhash - an abstract C library over real hash table implementations
  2. rspeed   - a performance program
  3. rbattle  - a benchmark tool


How to add an implementation.
=============================
Please remember that each implementation under test is simply a plugin.
So, go to the plugins/ directory and create a new one with the name of the
implementation. In this directory copy the following 3 files from an already
available implementation:

 1. Makefile
 2. README.c
 3. glue.c

and edit these files in order to meet the requirements.

- In file [Makefile] the only required definition to customize should be NAME and optionally
  the CFLAGS and C++FLAGS. Do not edit anything below the separator because the Makefile
  is automatically updated when needed.

- In file [README.c] the section to customize is that contains Plugin definitions

- In file [glue.c] must be implemented each function rhash_xxx() in order to map the
  virtual interface defined in rhash.h over the real implementation

When you have done please run in the directory with the new defined implementation
the following commands:
> make       (to compile everything)
> make run   (to run the testsuite)
> make leaks (to check for errors and memory leaks)

(make help provides you all the available rules)


Please not do forget ad the end of the process to add the name of the new directory
in plugins/Makefile
