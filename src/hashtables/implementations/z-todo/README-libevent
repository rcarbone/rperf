wrappers for libevent

There are 3 versions in 3 different directories:

 * ../libevent/
   this version relies on the definition of robj_t in datasets.h
   (which is included among the header files) and it uses the 'val'
   field as a pointer to the object itself

 * libevent/
   this version does not rely on the definition of robj_t in datasets.h
   and it needs to define its own object type and perform dynamic
   memory allocation/deallocation foreach object in the hash table

 * first-libevent/
   this version is now obsolete but it was left here only for reference
