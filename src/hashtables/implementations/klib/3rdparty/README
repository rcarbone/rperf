The following sources files were copied from latest git version without any modifications:
  - khash.h

  - khash.hh
    is a free C++ template library for hash tables that can be found here:
      http://attractivechaos.awardspace.com/khash.hh

    It is a C++ template library wrote before the author have shifted his focus on C macro library
    and the template library is not actively maintained.

    I made a fix to avoid a compiler warning and it is included here only for convenience.
