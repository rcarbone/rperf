The following sources files were copied from latest git version:
  - ansidecl.h
  - hashtab.h
  - hashtab.c

Moreover hashtab.c was locally modified in order to:

  - avoid to call xcalloc and therefore to depend also from additional xmalloc.c and xexit.c source files
  - fix a segmentation violation when attempt to delete items not already in the hash table

Some defines were also added to compile the sources on Linux systems:

#define HAVE_MALLOC_H
#define HAVE_STDINT_H
#define HAVE_STDLIB_H
#define HAVE_STRING_H
