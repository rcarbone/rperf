How to add a scenario
=====================

1. add in builtins/rlsuite.h the declaration of the function (near the end of the file)
2. add in builtins/suite.c an item in the static table of builtins scenarios
3. add in builtins/suite-code.c the implementation of the scenario in terms of rl_xxx() calls

4. add in etc/plugin.c
  a. an item in enum rlsuite_id_t
  b. a case in function run_this()
  c. a function to handle the call

5. update README.c foreach plugin


That's all folks!
