A library of Unit Tests for rtree
=================================

All the Unit Tests defined here are implemented in terms
of the virtual interface rtree and when linked with the
dummy implementation in ../rut/ do more or less nothing.


API
===
unsigned rtree_ut_argc (void);
rut_t * rtree_ut_argv (void);


1. The file [builtins.c] implements the functions of Unit Tests
   and group them all together in a static table, accessible
   via the rtree_ut_[argc, argv] functions

2. The file [run-ut.c] implements a main program to Display/Select/Run Unit Tests
