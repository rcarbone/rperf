There are 2 versions in 2 different directories:

 * general/
   this version does not rely on the definition of robj_t in datasets.h
   and it needs to define its own object type and perform dynamic
   memory allocation/deallocation foreach object in the hash table

 * private/
   this version relies on the definition of robj_t in datasets.h
   (which is included among the header files) and it uses the 'val'
   field as a pointer to the object itself

 * first-version/
    it is now obsolete but left here only for reference
